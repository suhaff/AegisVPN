      <h2>Why You Need a VPN</h2>

      <p className="long-text">
        Every time you connect to the internet without protection, your IP
        address, location, browsing habits, and personal data are exposed to
        ISPs, advertisers, hackers, and even governments.
      </p>

      <p className="long-text">
        AegisVPN encrypts your internet traffic through secure tunnels, making
        your data unreadable to third parties. Whether you're using public Wi-Fi,
        streaming content, gaming, or working remotely, AegisVPN ensures total
        privacy and unrestricted access.
      </p>

      <p className="long-text">
        We operate a strict no-logs policy. We do not track, store, or sell your
        data. Your privacy is not a feature — it is the foundation.
